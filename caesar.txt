Adding this to a feature branch.

This is a vi window, I love my vi window.
I need a couple of lines for some reason.
adding an additinal line and putting some additional content
and another one, whoa, that's a lot of lines.
Now I need neve more lines
and more lines.... this is out of control.
two more lines are needed
when will we have enough?
adding additional lines
again
adding this line to create a conflict.....
Let's see what happens!
and a extra line for good measure
